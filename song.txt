Days like this I want to drive away
Pack my bags and watch your shadow fade
'Cause you chewed me up and spit me out
Like I was poison in your mouth
You took my light, you drink me down
That was then and this is now, now look at me

This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me
No!
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me
No!
Throw your sticks an' the stones, throw your palms an' your clothes
But you're not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me
No!

I just wanna throw my phone away
Find out who is really there for me
'Cause you rip me off, your love was cheap
Was always tearing at the seams
I fell deep and you let me drown
But that was then and this is now, now look at me

Now look at me I'm sparkling
A firework a dancing flame.
You won't ever put me out again,
I'm glowing, oh woah
So you can keep the diamond ring,
it don't mean nothing anyway
In fact you can keep everything, yeah, yeah
Except for me
