Days like this I want to drive away
Pack my bags and watch your shadow fade
'Cause you chewed me up and spit me out
Like I was poison in your mouth
You took my light, you drink me down
That was then and this is now, now look at me

This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me
No!
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me
No!
Throw your sticks an' the stones, throw your palms an' your clothes
But you're not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me
No!
